# MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline Bug: $unwind and $group with Empty Arrays

This repository demonstrates a potential issue in MongoDB aggregation pipelines involving the `$unwind` and `$group` stages when handling documents with empty arrays. The issue arises when the array field being unwound is sometimes empty, leading to incorrect results or errors.

## Bug Description

The provided JavaScript code showcases an aggregation pipeline designed to join and group data from two collections. However, if the `relatedDocuments` array is empty for certain documents in `collectionA`, the `$unwind` operation might throw an error or generate unexpected results in the `$group` stage.

## Solution

The solution involves adding a `$match` stage before `$unwind` to filter out documents with empty `relatedDocuments` arrays and a `$group` stage, before `$unwind`, to only include documents with populated arrays, thereby preventing errors and ensuring accurate aggregation results.
